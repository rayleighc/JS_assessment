1) What did you like about this project?
This is really challanging which pushed me to think really hard.
Thankfully there are initial codes written for us to start with.

2) What did you struggle with in this project?
The logic to move the Character based on array values

3) What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Honestly, I don't think i will be able to finish in 3.5 hours.
Therefore, the time given is just right for me.
